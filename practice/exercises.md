# Exercises

1. Change the program so it reads two arguments from the command line, and prints out a message using both of them.
2. Change the program so it performs a simple arithmetic operation on the two arguments and prints out the result. You can use `read` to convert a string to a number, and `show` to convert a number back into a string. Play around with different operations.

3. `getLine` is an IO action that reads a line from the console and returns it as a string. Change the program so it prompts for a name, reads the name, and then prints that instead of the command line value.
